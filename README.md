## Project Charter

* Vision: This app aims to help users find other users with similar personality traits. If deployed in professional settings, the app can also help users make informed decisions about who to team up with on a business project.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91912255/161860970-32e400b7-006a-4ecd-a54d-924d6ce91028.png)

* Mission:
* Success Criteria:
  * Machine learning performance metric:
  * Because the recommendation system uses unsupervised learning algorithms, we will rely on the silhoutte score and reduction in SSE to select the optimal number of clusters, and use the Kaiser criteria for dimensionality reduction and factor analysis. There's no hard success threshold we can aim for &ndash, but I hope to retain features that capture around 95% of the variation in the data as I perform factor analysis.
Once the app is launched, we can then calculate the precision, recall, AUC, and F1 score of our recommendation engine based on dynamic user feedback. Tinder's current algorithm has an astonishing AUC of 90% and F1 of 85% â€“ these are the numbers I'll be aiming for.
Business metric:
We can measure the business value of the app based on user acquisition rates, churn rates, user engagement metrics (e.g. average session duration and total time on app), and of course, the number of successful matches made based on user feedback (e.g. number of successful matches divided by total time on app per user).
