## Project Charter

* Vision: This app aims to help hotels manage revenue and booking by identify potential booking cancellations. If deployed in business setting, this app could accurately predict which individual and specific reservations are going to cancel, and hotels can cultivate revenue management techniques accordingly. 

* Mission: In 2019 (pre-Covid), 49.8% of bookings reserved on the OTA Booking.com were cancelled, and booking cancellations are undoubtedly one the biggest headaches of any revenue manager or hotel manager nowadays. The data for this project was extracted from a real hotel business property management system (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/code?datasetId=511638&sortBy=voteCount). The cancellation prediction engine employs the best classification model for predicting bookings cancellations and finding the best explaining variables for customer cancellations. With this information hotels can, for example, contact clients that the model predicted will cancel in order to get a cancellation earlier - so they can have more time to resell the room. Or perhaps approach the client in a way to make them feel special and keep their reservation and therefore cancel the others he or she had made in other hotels in the same city.



* Success Criteria:
  * Machine learning performance metric: The classification algorithm will be evaluated using the precision, recall, AUC, and F1 score of our cancellation prediction engine. To be more specific, an AUC of 90% and F1 of 85% are the numbers I'll be aiming for.
* Business metric:
  * Clear and engaging user interface mapping simplified inputs to the underlying feature space
  * App-based metrics including user acquisition rates, churn rates, user engagement metrics, and hotel-related metrics such as revenue, vaccancy rate, booking rate, and etc.
